    "\n",
    "At high-flux synchrotron lightsources like the NSLS-II, we often employ 2D large area-detectors to quickly gather powder diffraction data by measuring a wide bandwidth of reciprocal-space in a single measurement.  In this transmission geometry, the Debye-Scherrer cones are captured as circles on the detector.  These 2D images can be azimuthally integrated to process (or reduce) the data from the 2D-image format into the commonly encounter 1-D representation of diffraction peaks as Intensity vs. momentum-transfer vector ($Q$) or Intensity vs. scattering angle ($2\\theta$).\n",

    "<img src=\"./static/HEX-2D-diffraction.png\" alt=\"Powder Diffraction on an Area Detector\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  [(image source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HEX-2D-diffraction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method of collecting diffraction data has the advantage of being very fast, allowing for in situ diffraction and total scattering studies of materials.  For example, we can measure at a 10 Hz frame rate out to $Q = 25 \\, Ã…^{-1}$ at the PDF Beamline (28-ID-1) at NSLS-II.  However, one challenge of this approach is that these large area-detectors often suffer from issues of burn-in, ghosting, and other so-called 'dark image' effects on the detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address many of these issues, we employ a method called dark-image subtraction on the 2D-image data.  Put simply, we measure a 'dark' image on the detector when there is no light being exposed (i.e. the shutter is closed), in which presumably any static artifacts on the detector are captured.  This dark-image is then subtracted from any light-images (which we presume to also have these static artifacts) to produce a final clean image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Making things more complicated, these dark images must be regularly refreshed during the course of a beamtime.  These detectors can experience image-ghosting, particularly from strongly scattering materials or over-exposed images.   These ghost-images are essentially residual intensity on the detector that fades slowly with time.  Careful management of when to collect dark-images, how to recognize over-exposure, and best practices for efficient data collection are all part of a successful powder diffraction measurement using 2D area-detectors."

    "\n",
    "We have designed a simulated beamline that exhibits a simplified version of these detector effects that can be controlled with Bluesky.  Also key to this exercise, we simulated the passage of time and how it effects the image on the detector.  This is to say that simply leaving the notebook open will not cause the decay of ghosted after-images on the detector (these effects are not tied to the actual wallclock time).  Instead, explicit actions taken will move time forward.  The four possible actions you can take in this tutorial are:\n",

However, as \"Introductory Time Travel\" is saved for a future tutorial, we are recommending against it at this time, and are not responsible for any actions you may take or un-take.  It might break the simulation.  Please use time travel responsibly.\n",
